### 1. Principles of Universal Design

**Principle #2: Simple and Intuitive Use**

Our project incorporates simplicity and ease of use by focusing on a clean and minimalistic interface. Features like sortable columns and straightforward navigation make the portfolio easy to use, even for individuals with little technical knowledge. For example, users can sort their financial holdings by different criteria, such as ticker or quantity, which simplifies the process of locating specific information. These design choices make the platform approachable for both experienced and first-time users.

*Future Improvements:*\
To make the platform even more user-friendly, we could add onboarding guides or tooltips that explain key features and help new users navigate the system more effectively.

**Principle #4: Perceptible Information**
This principle is addressed through the use of visual aids like pie charts, which give users a clear and quick understanding of their portfolio's performance and asset allocation. Instead of just relying on raw numbers, these charts offer a more intuitive way to digest complex data at a glance.

*Future Improvements:*\
To ensure everyone can benefit from these visualizations, we could introduce features like a colorblind-friendly palette or text-based alternatives that describe the data shown in the charts. These changes would make the platform more inclusive for users with visual impairments.

### 2. Accessibility for Different Demographics
While our program is designed to be accessible to most users, there are some areas for improvement to make it more inclusive. For example, users with visual impairments might struggle with the heavy reliance on graphical elements like pie charts. To address this, we could add screen reader support and offer alternative data presentations. Similarly, users with cognitive disabilities might benefit from additional customization options or simplified workflows to make navigating the platform easier. These considerations would help ensure the program is accessible to everyone, regardless of their specific needs.

### 3. Marketing Strategy
Our platform would primarily appeal to financial advisors, experienced investors, and new investors who want a simple way to manage their portfolios. Financial advisors, for instance, could use the program to prepare clear and professional summaries for their clients. On the other hand, new investors would appreciate the accessible design and visual tools that simplify complex financial information. By emphasizing ease of use and clean, intuitive visuals, weâ€™ve created a tool that can serve a wide range of users, from seasoned professionals to those just starting their investing journey.
