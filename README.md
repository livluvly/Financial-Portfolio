By separating the core domain logic, application services, and user interfaces, the system ensures maintainability and extensibility, allowing future enhancements like additional asset types or advanced analytics with minimal impact on existing code.

### Why was it made?

### What problem does it solve?
### User Stories:

    1. Olivia - As someone who actively manages my own financial investments, I want to have a detailed history of all 
    the transactions that I have made in my portfolio and be able to sort transactions to view transactions easier. 
    I want to be able to track my investment activity, ensure my transactions are accurate, and monitor the gains and 
    losses. This is helpful to view when I want to see my most recent transaction and ensure that the transaction was as
    I intended, and to optimize my investment strategy by identifying successful patterns in my transactions.

    2. Areesha - Since I'm interested in managing my investments, I would like to have the option of securely managing 
    multiple accounts. This means being able to login and logout of accounts that I can create anytime.

    3. Bradley - As an investor, I want to verify and check the aggregate performance of my portfoilo. This includes 
    checking the total statistics of my portfolio, and also visually understanding how are my capitals allocated in 
    different assets in a pie chart. This is helpful so that I can make better foward looking "next steps" decisions 
    when I (re)allocate my capital.

    4. Ruizhen - As someone who's just entered stock market, I want to explore different investment option. I want to be able 
    to search up for assets that I could be interested in, and record any purchase I make from the search results. This 
    feature makes it convenient for me to explore different investment options and optimise my investment portfolio. 

    5. Team - As someone managing investments, I want the flexibility to tailor how I view my portfolio to suit my 
    preferences. This includes sorting my holdings by various criteria, such as quantity or total value  
    Having this option allows me to organize my assets in a specific order. Furthermore, I want to be able to check the 
    asset prices in different currencies. This use case makes it easier to analyze trends, track progress, and focus on 
    what aligns with my financial objectives.
