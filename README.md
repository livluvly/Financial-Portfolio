## Purpose & Scope:
This project was designed to provide users with a robust and intuitive tool for managing investment portfolios while showcasing the application of Clean Architecture principles. By separating the core domain logic, application services, and user interfaces, the system ensures maintainability and extensibility, allowing future enhancements like additional asset types or advanced analytics with minimal impact on existing code.

### Why was it made?
### What problem does it solve?
### User Stories:

    1. Olivia - As someone who actively manages my own financial investments, I want to have a detailed history of all 
    the transactions that I have made in my portfolio. I want to be able to track my investment activity, ensure my
    transactions are accurate, and monitor the gains and losses. This is helpful to view when I want to see my most
    most recent transaction and ensure that the transaction was as I intended, and to optimize my investment strategy by
    identifying successful patterns in my transactions.

    2. Areesha - As someone managing investments, I want the flexibility to tailor how I view my portfolio to suit my 
    preferences. This includes sorting my holdings by various criteria, such as quantity or total value . 
    Having this option allows me to organize my assets in a specific order, making it easier to analyze trends, track 
    progress, and focus on what aligns with my financial objectives.

    3. Bradley - As an investor, I want to verify and check the aggregate performance of my portfoilo. This includes 
    checking the total statistics of my portfolio, and also visually understanding how are my capitals allocated in 
    different assets in a pie chart. This is helpful so that I can make better foward looking "next steps" decisions 
    when I (re)allocate my capital.
